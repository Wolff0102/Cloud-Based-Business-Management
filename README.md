## What is Cloud-Based Business Management?

Cloud-based business management refers to using internet-hosted software and platforms to handle various business functions such as payroll, attendance tracking, project management, and team collaboration. Unlike traditional on-premise software that requires extensive hardware installations and maintenance, cloud-based solutions offer flexibility, scalability, and accessibility from anywhere in the world.

As a result, businesses can enhance efficiency, reduce operational costs, and ensure better data security. With the cloud, companies no longer need to worry about software updates, as service providers handle everything seamlessly.
